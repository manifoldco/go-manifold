## Overview

This *will* be the Go implementation of a client API for Manifold's
non-provider facing REST services. For now, it is unstable as we build it, and is
used to share code between some of our other packages.

If you are a provider, you'll want to look at
[grafton](https://github.com/manifoldco/grafton) for verifying your
implementation, or [go-signature](https://github.com/manifoldco/go-signature)
for verifying requests have come from Manifold instead.

## Releasing

To release a new version of this package, use the Make target `release`:

```
$ VERSION=0.1.2 make release
```

This will update the Version in `version.go`, commit the changes and set up a
new tag.
